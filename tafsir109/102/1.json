{"text": "Vying for increase distracts you. This is an address of admonishment and assertion. He is saying, “O child of Adam! Why do you boast of relationships that will soon be severed? Why do you vainly lift your heads over your many relatives, your property, and your position? Why are you deluded by the fact that you have been given respite and left without shame? Will you not look back before you reach the four walls of the grave, thrown down in exile and aloneness? Will you not apologize? You are not on guard because you are not aware. In no way do you take the road to wholesomeness and deliverance, for you are drunk on avarice and appetite.”"}
