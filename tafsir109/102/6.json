{"text": "You shall surely see the Blaze, then you shall see it with the eye of certainty. This surely is that of an oath. The Lord of the Worlds is swearing an oath and saying, “In truth, you servants will all see hell with the eye of certainty, a seeing without supposition or doubt.” This is just what He says elsewhere: “And none of you there is but will enter it” [19:71]. The person of faith will see it while passing by, and the unbeliever will see it as a settling place. MuṣṬafā said, “The best thing cast into the heart is certainty, and certainty is faith, all of it. Surely God in His equity and justice placed repose and joy in certainty and approval, and He placed concerns and sorrow in doubt and anger.” He is saying, “The best seed that is planted in the faithful person's breast is the seed of certain- ty, and all of faith is certainty. Certainty is a fortified fortress for faith and a firm cord for the pos- sessor of faith. With beautiful gentleness, perfect generosity, bounty without inclination, justice without iniquity, and gentleness without cause, the Real placed all ease and comfort, all security and unconcern, all happiness and revelry, in the right hand of certainty and the garden of approval. Then with a decree without ulterior motive and a knowledge without suspicion, He placed all grief and misfortune, suffering and tribulation, in doubt and disapproval. It has also been said that certainty has three pillars: the knowledge of certainty, the eye of certainty, and the truth of certainty. The knowledge of certainty settles down in the breast, the eye of certainty settles down in the secret core, and the truth of certainty settles down in the spirit. The knowledge of certainty discourses on faith, the eye of certainty gives marks of self-purifi-cation, and the truth of certainty throws into the rightful due of recognition. Blessedness belongs to him who walks in the world of certainty's knowledge! Nearness be- longs to him who sees a trace of the face-to-face vision of certainty's eye! The most beautiful belongs to him who finds awareness of the reality of certainty's truth!"}
