{"text": "Those who have faith and do wholesome deeds, who perform the prayer and give the alms tax, shall have their wage with their Lord, and no fear shall be upon them, neither shall they grieve. In other words, “Enough for those who come to be Ours will be what they find with Us, for We leave not to waste the wage of those who do beautiful deeds [18:30].” “When someone has recourse to the gate of Our generosity, We give him shelter in the shade of Our blessings. When the dust of Our path falls on someone, the darkness of separation from Us will not fall upon him. When someone takes one step toward Us, he will find a gift with Us.” In other words, “When someone joins with Us, he will escape from the night attack of severance.” Or: “When someone binds his heart to Our generosity, he will pack his bags from the room of sor- rows.” Or: “When someone sees Us, his spirit will laugh. He who reaches himself will reach Us. Nothing can be said about what he who reaches himself will see and hear.” The Pir of the Tariqah said, “O God, all Your caresses are for our sake, for in each breath ap- pears so much burning with the light of Your solicitude. Who has a patron like You? Where is a friend like You? With the attributes that You have, nothing else is fitting. All this is the mark, and the celebration is tomorrow. This indeed is the message, and the robe of honor is in place.” The robe of honor is what He said: “shall have their wage with their Lord, and no fear shall be upon them, neither shall they grieve.” Wait until tomorrow, when He gives out the generous wage and tremendous caress that He has with Himself, the boundless blessings and everlasting triumph, in the assembly of repose and ease [56:89] and the appointed time of union with the Beloved. When will my luck smile at me from Your playing field? When will separation from You strike its tent from my spirit's desert? What wonderful work is the work of the poor! Gabriel, with six hundred peacock wings, could not take one step beyond the Lote Tree along with that paragon of the world.  But this poor man with begging hands does not let go of the paragon's skirt until he places his foot along with his on the Majestic Throne. Know, however, that this boldness does not belong to today, for it is longtime. When the foundation of love was laid down in the beginningless covenant, the spirits of the poor drank one draft of the wine of He loves them, and they love Him [5:54] in the session of intimacy and on the carpet of expansiveness. This is why they became bold. The proximate angels of the Higher Plenum said, “Look at the high aspiration of this folk! After all, we never tasted a draft of that wine, nor even caught a whiff.” The ruckus of these beggars' spirits fell to Capella: First You began this talk of passion, so take care of our work as is worthy of You. How can we find room in the pavilion of mystery? We have nothing in hand but bragging and the edict of need."}
