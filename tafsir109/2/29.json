{"text": "He it is who created for you all that is in the earth, then He went up to heaven and propor- tioned it as seven heavens, and He is knower of everything. In another place He said, “He subjected to you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, all together, from Him” [45:13]. He is saying, “I created everything in the empire of the earth for you and subjected it to you. My bestowal is not tiny, My generosity toward those who are burnt for Me is not trivial. There will never be any backsliding in My caressing you. Nor is it as if I limited Myself to the empire of the earth, for I also set up the heavens for your gaze, for the pleasure of your eyes, and as a storehouse for your daily provision. My servant! When you step into the street of My covenant, you do not know what good news reaches the heaven-dwellers and the earth-dwellers and how they congratulate each other. I know, for I know everything and reach everyone.” And He is knower of everything. In this verse there is a subtle point. He did not say, “Who created you for all that is in the earth.” He said, “Who created for you all that is in the earth.” In other words, “I created every- thing that is in the empire of the earth and the heavens for your sake, and I created you for My sake.” Do you not see that He said specifically to Moses, “I chose thee for Myself” [20:41], and generally to the creatures, “I created the jinn and mankind only to worship Me” [51:56]? It was MuṣṬafā who understood the worth of this declaration and gave thanks for this one of His blessings. On the night of proximity and generosity when he was taken to the heavens, all of creation and the empires of the two worlds were scatted at the feet of his truthfulness. That paragon did not look at it from the corner of his eye. He said, “I was not created for this.” The eyesight did not swerve, nor did it trespass [53:17]. Hail to him! Abū Yazīd BasṬāmī, who beautifully traveled in the road of MuṣṬafā's Sunnah and beautifully observed courtesy toward the Presence, said, “I kept on crossing perils until I found the empires.  Then I left the empires behind and arrived at the marks giving witness to the King. I said, 'The prize.' “He said, 'I have given to you all that you have seen.' “I said, 'You are the desired.' “He said, 'Then I belong to you, just as you belong to Me.'” The Pir of the Tariqah said, “O God, when a breeze blew from the garden of friendship, I made my heart its sacrifice. I found a scent of friendship's treasury and called out in kingship over the world. Lightning flashed from the east of the Haqiqah, and with little thought of water and clay I left the two worlds behind. You gazed once, and in that gaze I burned and melted. Add another gaze and make it the salve of this burned one! Grasp this drowned man, for the remedy and salve of the wine-stricken is wine!” In this meaning Majnūn sang, I treated love for Laylā with Laylā just as the wine-drinker is treated with wine."}
