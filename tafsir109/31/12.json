{"text": "And We gave Luqmān wisdom. Know that wisdom is correct activity or correct speech. Correct activity is to preserve the balance of interaction with self between fear and hope, with the people between tenderness and cajolery, and with the Real between awe and intimacy. Correct speech is that you do not mix levity with the mention of the Real, you preserve reverence, and you connect the end of every talk with its begin- ning. The wise man is he who puts everything in its own place, does each work as is worthy of that work, and ties each thing to its equal. This wisdom comes forth from someone who renounces this world and perseveres in worship. MuṣṬafā said, “When someone is a renunciant in this world, God will give wisdom a home in his heart and bring his tongue to speech with it.” ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib said, “Vivify the hearts and seek for them the fine qualities of wisdom, for they become weary just as bodies become weary.” Ḥusayn ibn Manṣūr said, “Wisdom is an arrow, and the hearts of the faithful are its targets. The shooter is God, so error is made nonexistent.” It has been said, “Wisdom is God-given knowledge.” It has also been said, “It is the light that distinguishes between inspiration and Satanic dis- quiet.” It was said to one of them, “Whence is born this light in the heart?” He said, “From reflective thought and heedfulness, and these are bequeathed by sorrow and hunger.”"}
