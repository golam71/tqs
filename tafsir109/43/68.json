{"text": "O My servants, no fear is upon you today, neither will you sorrow. Just as He said in the Beginningless, “My servants,” so He Himself will say in the Endless, “My servants.” In the Beginningless He said, “O My servants, you are My creation and I am your Lord, so present your needs to Me.” In the Endless He will say, “My servants, no fear is upon you today, neither will you sorrow.” This indeed will be addressed to the generality of the faithful. As for the sincerely truthful and the near ones, He will address them with this: “My servants, did you yearn for Me? Did you love to encounter Me?” This will be an exalted state and a great rank: the intender will have reached the Intended, the seeker the Sought, the lover the Beloved. The tree of union will bear fruit, the messenger of the Sought will come forth, and the Companion will come out with the stipulation of passion. At last the Friend will come out with the stipulation of passion- the suffering of my passion for Him will come to an end."}
