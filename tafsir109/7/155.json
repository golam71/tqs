{"text": "And Moses chose his people, seventy men, for Our appointed time, and when the earth- quake took them, he said … “It is naught but Thy trial. Thou misguidest thereby whomsoever Thou wilt and Thou guidest whomsoever Thou wilt. Thou art our Friend, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, and Thou art the best of forgivers!” There is a difference between the community of Moses and the community of MuḤammad. The community of Moses was chosen by Moses, for He says, “And Moses chose his people.” The community of MuḤammad was chosen by God, for He says, “We chose them, with a knowledge, above the worlds” [44:32]. Then He said about those chosen by Moses, “They said, 'Show us God openly,' and the thunderbolt took them because of their wrongdoing” [4:153]. Here He says, “The earthquake took them.” Concerning those He Himself chose He said, “Faces that day will be radi- ant, gazing upon their Lord” [75:22-23]. The want is the want of the Real, the choice the choice of the Real. God says, “And thy Lord creates what He wants and chooses. They have no choice” [28:68]. Moses was bold on the carpet of proximity in the station of whispered prayer. He had the attribute of realization in the state of brokenness and poverty because of anguish and bewilderment, and he showed this remorse: “It is naught but Thy trial.” Then he perceived himself and returned to the attribute of incapacity and brokenness, entering from the door of awe and veneration. He threw the decree entirely back to the Real: “Thou misguidest whom Thou wilt, and Thou guidest whom Thou wilt.” He was not content with this, so he loosed the tongue of laudation and connected it with pleading and weeping: “Thou art our Friend, so forgive us and have mercy upon us.” He displayed his need and lowliness to Him and asked for mercy and forgiveness. He said, “So forgive us and have mercy upon us, and Thou art the best of forgivers!” It has come in the traditions that on the day of the whispered prayer, Moses reached the edge of Mount Sinai. With every step he took, he lauded God, called upon Him, and displayed a need. The Pir of the Tariqah said, “There is no rejecting the needy, there is no deception behind the door of need, and there is no means of approach to the Friend like need.  ” When Moses reached the station of whispered prayer, the tree of his need gave fruit, and the instances of bounty came forth. The night of separation went down and the day of union rose up. Moses had yearning in the heart, remembrance on the tongue, love in the spirit, and staff in hand. The call came from the Compeller of all engendered beings, “O Moses, it is the moment of secret whispering, the time of joy, the day of access. O Moses, ask and it will be given to you. What do you need? What gift do you want? O Moses, ask and I will bestow, speak so that I may listen.” The Pir of the Tariqah said, “The servant who is wanted by the Real and worthy of His love is adorned with solicitude, given entrance by bounty, cloaked in a robe of honor by love, and caressed with generosity so that he may become bold. Then he is passed back and forth between jealousy and love. Sometimes jealousy shuts the door and the servant's tongue begins to beg, sometimes love opens the door and the servant is filled with the joy of face-to-face vision.”"}
