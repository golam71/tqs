{"text": "Say: “Praise belongs to God. He will show you His signs, and you will recognize them.” This road can be traversed with three way stations: first showing, then traveling, then being pulled. Showing is this: “He will show you His signs, and you will recognize them.” Traveling is what He said: “And He created you in stages” [71:14]; “You shall surely ride stage after stage” [84:19]. Being pulled is what He said: “Then He drew close, so He came down” [53:8]. About showing He said in the case of Abraham, “We were showing Abraham the dominion of the heavens and the earth” [6:75]. Again, He spoke of traveling on the part of Moses: “Surely with me is my Lord; He will guide me” [26:62]. He spoke of being pulled in the case of MuṣṬafā the Arab: “Who took His servant by night” [17:1]. You poor wretch! You have lost the road, you have remained in yourself, you have not taken the road to the road. You have traveled lifetimes in yourself and not reached anywhere. Your traveling is like that great pir said: I was young when He said, “May your nights be sweet!” I became old in passion but my night did not become day. O chevalier! Take a step outside of yourself so that the road may become clear and your Compan- ion may appear to you. Have you not heard the words spoken by the Pir of the Tariqah: “O gone out of yourself with- out reaching the Friend! Do not let your heart be tight, for in each breath your companion is He. Exalted is he who is scarred by Him! On His road is he who has His lamp! This is why the Lord of the Worlds said, 'So he is upon a light from his Lord' [39:22].”"}
