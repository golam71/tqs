{"text": "So let man consider of what he was created. Let the human individual look carefully at himself: From what was he created and why was he cre- ated? God created a face that is suited for prostration, eyes suited for taking heed, a body suited for service, a heart suited for recognition, a secret core suited for love. So remember God's blessings upon you [2:231], for He adorned your tongues with the Shahadah, your hearts with recognition and felicity, and your bodies with service and worship."}
